## Set Up
1. Download [Chrome Driver](https://www.automationtestinghub.com/download-chrome-driver/)
2. Set up chrome driver path on variable **chromedriver_path**
3. Set up your chrome profile on variable **MAC_CHROME_PROFILE** (Allows to keep login session everytime you run the script)
4. Uncomment code (look at comments) the first time so the script logs in for you, then comment the code back 
### Changes:
* Updated to use Instagram's new css selectors
